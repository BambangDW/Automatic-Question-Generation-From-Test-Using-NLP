The National Capital Region (NCR) and its planning board were created under the National Capital Region Planning Board Act of 1985. That 1985 Act defined the NCR as being the whole of NCT of Delhi the Haryana districts of Gurgaon, Faridabad (then including Palwal), Rohtak (then including Jhajjar), Sonipat, and the Rewari and Panipat tehsils then in Mahendragarh; and the Uttar Pradesh districts of Bulandshahr, Meerut and Ghaziabad (including Hapur Tehsil), and some of the Rajasthan district of Alwar. The 1985 boundary of the NCR covered an area of 34,144 km. In July 2013, NCR was expanded to include three more districts, Bhiwani, and Mahendragarh in the state of Haryana, as well as Bharatpur in the state of Rajasthan. This brought the number of districts in NCR to 19 (outside Delhi NCT), with the total NCR area increasing 34% to 45,887 km. Subsequently, Charkhi Dadri district was separated from Bhiwani district in 2016. On 9 June 2015 the Government of India approved the inclusion of three more districts in NCR - Jind and Karnal in the state of Haryana and Muzaffarnagar in U.P. There are now a total of 22 districts (outside Delhi NCT) within NCR, covering a total area of 50,566 km.
